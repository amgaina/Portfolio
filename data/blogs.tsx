  <p>At ULM's "Everyone Has a Story" Symposium on October 3rd, 2023, I was honored to deliver a keynote presentation titled <strong>"Blazing Trails to Success in Web Development and Mobile Development."</strong> For sixty minutes, I shared my professional journey - the challenges, breakthroughs, and lessons learned while navigating the tech industry.</p>

  <div class="my-4 p-4 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/10 rounded-lg">
    <p>The heart of my talk focused on three core areas:</p>
    <ul class="mt-2 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Breaking into tech:</strong> Practical strategies for launching a web development career</li>
      <li><strong>Essential toolkit:</strong> Must-have project management skills for developers</li>
      <li><strong>Client workflow:</strong> Our proven process from initial consultation to final delivery</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>I demonstrated how tools like Figma, React, and Git become powerful allies in managing projects efficiently. The audience particularly engaged during our deep dive into client communication strategies and team leadership approaches refined through real project experiences.</p>

  <p>What made this experience truly special was the exchange of ideas afterward - students sharing their aspirations, professionals offering additional insights, and that rewarding moment when complex concepts "click" for someone. These interactions reminded me why sharing our stories matters in shaping the next generation of tech professionals.</p>

      <p>The Biomedical Research and Industry Day at ULM on October 20th, 2024 wasn't just another academic conference - it was a masterclass in translational research. The crisp autumn air carried a sense of urgency as researchers discussed how to bridge the gap between lab discoveries and patient outcomes.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Learning From the Best</h3>
      <p>Dr. El Sayed's keynote on natural product drug discovery left me scribbling notes:</p>
      <ul class="space-y-2 mt-2">
        <li>How marine sponge compounds are being repurposed for cancer therapies</li>
        <li>The "fail fast" approach to screening thousands of compounds</li>
        <li>Ethical considerations in bioprospecting</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Meanwhile, Dr. Stevenson's talk on AI-assisted diagnostics revealed how machine learning models are achieving radiologist-level accuracy in detecting early-stage tumors from imaging scans.</p>
      
      <div class="my-6 p-6 bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 rounded-xl border-l-4 border-green-500">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-green-700 dark:text-green-300 mb-2">Our Contribution</h4>
        <p>Our poster presentation on <strong>"Cancer Disparities Among African Americans in Louisiana"</strong> (with Dr. Sreekumari) analyzed five years of state cancer registry data. The most striking finding? While incidence rates followed national trends, mortality rates showed significant regional variations that couldn't be explained by access to care alone.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Data Tells a Story</h3>
      <p>Working with Python's data stack (Pandas for wrangling, Seaborn for visualization), we uncovered:</p>
      <ul class="space-y-2 mt-2">
        <li>A 23% higher mortality rate in rural parishes compared to urban centers</li>
        <li>Strong correlation between food desert areas and late-stage diagnoses</li>
        <li>Promising outliers - communities beating the odds through innovative outreach programs</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The most rewarding moment came when a community health worker shared how our visualizations helped secure funding for mobile screening units. This experience cemented my belief that data science isn't just about numbers - it's about people.</p>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">Louisiana State University Alexandria | March 2025</p>
  </div>

  <p>The Louisiana Academy of Sciences conference at LSU Alexandria was one of those perfect academic gatherings - the kind where stimulating presentations blend seamlessly with warm conversations over coffee and sandwiches. The friendly atmosphere made it easy to discuss research with professors from across the state.</p>

  <div class="my-4 p-4 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/10 rounded-lg">
    <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">About My Presentation</h3>
    <p>I demonstrated our "Subnetting Visualization Tool" to computer science educators during the afternoon technical session. The 15-minute presentation covered:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
      <li>How interactive learning improves subnetting comprehension</li>
      <li>Key features like real-time feedback and adaptive challenges</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>The Q&A session was particularly rewarding, with several networking instructors asking about implementing the tool in their courses.</p>

  <div class="my-4 p-4 bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/10 rounded-lg">
    <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Conference Highlights</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
      <li>Engaging keynote on science education reform</li>
      <li>Delicious local food during networking breaks</li>
      <li>Surprise award announcement during closing ceremonies</li>
      <li>Great conversations with researchers from different disciplines</li>
    </ul>
